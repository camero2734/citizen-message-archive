But as scared as I am to confront your dedication, I have to urge to look deeper to find the truth in the bishops, and how they have come intOO power. There are cracks, and these cracks should be peered into, searching for revelation. They are not a force of good, they are merely a force of tradition. I have dug deeper, and I know this tradition has dark secrets, and this \"Gone\" that they proclaim as honorable, I assure you, is anything but. I have found true freedom outside of these walls, and I YYearn to return to that wild freedom. But we need help from people like you, people on the inside of the towers. I wouldn't be asking you if I hadn't detected a hint of doubt in the validity of Vialism. I believe you do see the cracks. I'm hoping we can break them open. I hope you join us in destroying this tyranny. I hope you join our quest for actual glory.\n\nSincerely,\nMara"

THHe bishops, our symbol of stoic control, have become frantic, and for the first time, unclear and worried about what is next. Keons meant everything to me, and it's not the same without him here. But I'm now seeing that Keons was what I admired, not Vialism. I don't even know what it means to be a Vialist anymore. I see them diffEErently, I see deception. I see rage. Your letter has confirmed some of my doubts, and has begun to ignite a new passion to destroy this construct that has deceived me for so long.
